What is WellCommerce?
---------------------

WellCommerce is an e-commerce platform for PHP 5.4+. It can be used to develop all kind of shops and extend them in the way you like.

The code is still hot but it only gets cooler :). Here are most important things which we have used to create this solution:

- [Symfony2 Full-stack framework][1]
- [Doctrine2 ORM][2]
- [Behat BDD framework][3]
- [Twig template engine][4]
- [Twitter Bootstrap 3 as a base HTML framework][5]

Requirements
------------

WellCommerce is only supported on PHP 5.4 and up. 

Installation
------------

As WellCommerce uses [Composer][6] to manage its dependencies, the recommended way
to create a new project is to use it.

If you don't have Composer yet, download it following the instructions on
http://getcomposer.org/ or just run the following command:

    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Then, use the `create-project` command to generate a new WellCommerce application:

    php composer.phar create-project wellcommerce/wellcommerce -s dev path/to/wellcommerce

Composer will install WellCommerce and all its dependencies under the `path/to/wellcommerce` directory.
